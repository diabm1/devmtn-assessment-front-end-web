Part 1: Edit HTML

    Change the following things in home.html.

[x] Change the image of the Devmountain logo to an image of either a rubber duck or a cat of your choice.

[x] Add another paragraph somewhere on the page. The content of the paragraph should be a message welcoming the user to the website.

[x] Add a bulleted list (ul) of compliments to the user, with at least 3 bullet points.

[x] Add a form input to the “Contact Us” form that asks the user how they heard about this website. They should be able to check boxes that include “Google”, “A friend”, or “Other”.


Part 2: Edit Javascript

[x] Change the event listener that is listening for the Contact Us form to submit. Instead of doing a console.log message on submit, the form should alert the user that the form has been submitted successfully. Use the alert function in Javascript.

[x] Add an event listener that listens for a mouseover event. When the user mouses over the picture on the page (cat or rubber duck) the page should alert give the user a compliment.


Part 3: Create HTML Page

[] Edit the file called profile.html. Make a profile about yourself.

The profile should feature your skills, interests, and career goals. Be creative and try practice using basic HTML elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, and forms, as well as CSS concepts such as classes and flexbox.

[] Feel free to copy the head and nav components from the home.html

page so that your profile has the same look and feel as the other pages on the website.
